* Vertical detection from note heads
* Eliminate false positives for note heads (sharp symbol, Bass cleff)
* Beam detection.
* Chord detections.
* Flags detection.
* Ties and slurs detections.
* Remove ledger lines
* Check if accidentals can be detected.
* Whole note and half note detection to be done and corresponding verticals to be detected
* Fix bug in staff line detection (staff bound rect, line aggregation)
* Try to use shortest path for beam detection rather than blind implementatin of connected
  components.

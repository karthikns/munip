* <strike>Vertical detection from note heads</strike>
* Eliminate false positives for note heads (sharp symbol, Bass cleff)
* <strike>Beam detection</strike>
* <strike>Chord detections</strike>
* Flags detection.
* Ties and slurs detections {
         One approach is to consider redrawing stafflines in different colour after detection of all
         sybols except slur/tie. This way broken segements are rejoined without affecting detection
         of other symbols.
}
* Remove ledger lines {
         One approach could be to consider each chord rectangle and then remove thin horizontal
         segments whose dimenstions are in the range of staff line height.
}
* Check if accidentals can be detected.
* Whole note and half note detection to be done and corresponding verticals to be detected {
         An independent approach can be used as neither half nor whole note are beamed or flagged.
}
* Fix bug in staff line detection (staff bound rect, line aggregation)
* <strike>Try to use shortest path for beam detection rather than blind implementatin of connected
  components.</strike>
* <strike>Stems' actual coordinates not correctly determined yet (top and bottom are that of StaffBoundRect)
    Fix this!! This is very important for robustifying beam detection.</strike>

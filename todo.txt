* Eliminate false positives for note heads (sharp symbol, Bass cleff)
* Flags detection {
         Implemented a crude flag detection algorithm based on black - white
         transitions.
         To robustify, either ledger lines should be eliminated neatly or some
         shape matching for flags should be performed.
}
* Ties and slurs detections {
         One approach is to consider redrawing stafflines in different colour after detection of all
         sybols except slur/tie. This way broken segements are rejoined without affecting detection
         of other symbols.
}
* Remove ledger lines {
         One approach could be to consider each chord rectangle and then remove thin horizontal
         segments whose dimenstions are in the range of staff line height.
}
* Check if accidentals can be detected.
* Whole note and half note detection to be done and corresponding verticals to be detected {
         An independent approach can be used as neither half nor whole note are beamed or flagged.
}
* Fix bug in staff line detection (staff bound rect, line aggregation)
* For beam detection, better algorithm would be draw beams in different color (workImage). This way
  testing for stem pixel will be reduced to O(1) and the algo would be more robust.
* Handle special case where wide note head region is induced due to thickened beams which are removed
  with assumption that its cleff or some wider symbol. {
         Probably a check for stems can be made and then appropriately segmented.
}

* While computing and storing max H projection, also think of storing the position which contributed
   to max projection. This can probably used to get rid of beams interfering note detection.

COMPLETED TODOS
===============
* Vertical detection from note heads
* Beam detection
* Chord detections
* Try to use shortest path for beam detection rather than blind implementatin of connected
  components.
* Stems' actual coordinates not correctly determined yet (top and bottom are that of StaffBoundRect)
    Fix this!! This is very important for robustifying beam detection.
* Fix the flaw marked in StaffData::extractNoteHeadSegmetns(), won't scale when there are 0 entries
  rather than missing keys.
